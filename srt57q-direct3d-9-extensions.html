Direct3D is a graphics application programming interface (API) for Microsoft Windows.Part of DirectX, Direct3D is used to render three-dimensional graphics in applications where performance is important, such as games. Install reshade in your base folder for this game, or any other game that supports it. https://reshade.me/ If you have an ultra wide screen monitor, https://www.reddit.com/r/HaloOnline/comments/41wo54/halo_online_219/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uYshTizO-o (skip to 3:59 to see a quick comparison) The game looks dramatically better, you can do a lot more then what I did. My setup is to have better graphics while keeping the game totally playable. Some settings will hinder performance. DirectX 9 was released in 2002 for Windows 98 through XP, and currently on or supported by all subsequent versions. Microsoft continues to make changes in DirectX 9c, causing support to be dropped for some of the aforementioned operating systems. 
I have been working on a program with the WinAPI and DirectX9. Before anyone tells me I shouldn't be using DirectX9, I just want to actually finish a project so completing this and actually making it work will be more spiritual for me. When I run the game (F5) in Debug mode the program runs fine. For whatever reason, I think errors are actually bugged in VS2019 so they don't pop up normally. But from what I can scan, there are no errors in Debug mode. I just get warnings about unitializatio. High Dynamic Range lighting has been used in games for a long time, popularized by titles like Valve’s Half-Life 2 using DirectX 9.0c.The rendering uses float-point render targets, allowing the lighting to exceed the normal 0 to 1 range. I have been playing Lost Alpha 1.4007 DC for a while now but every now and then I get a crash which is obnoxious, with overclock and without.

I released a game a few months ago that I put a lot of work into optimising size and speed. The game is an RPG that runs on modern systems and is almost exactly 2 MB to download on Windows. Here's a link to the homepage of the game where you can get an idea what it's like: https://nooskewl.ca/monster-rpg-3 (https://nooskewl.ca/monster-rpg-3) amp#x200B; I thought I'd write a post about some of the optimisations I did and how you can achieve a small download size. Please note, I know people.

What I mean by that is that, if I want to open Chrome, this thing can take up to two minutes and sometimes more loading and appears as if it freezes. This will happen everytime I want to open something, look for something in the browser, etc. I have downloaded all drivers. It also happens.

Hello, I recently migrated from Arch and I can't manage to get Overwatch working (it used to work on Arch). I have an AMD GPU. I used the Lutris script and got Battle.net running, but if I launch the game I get these error messages: libGL error: unable to load driver: radeonsi_dri.so libGL error: driver pointer missing libGL error: failed to load driver: radeonsi libGL error: unable to load driver: radeonsi_dri.so libGL error: driver pointer missing libGL error: failed. 
Driven by the insatiable market demand for realtime, high-definition 3D graphics, the programmable Graphic Processor Unit or GPU has evolved into a highly parallel, multithreaded, manycore processor with tremendous computational horsepower and very high memory bandwidth, as illustrated by Figure 1 and Figure. There is strong push toward supporting Direct3D on Linux. There seem to be 2 major ways to do this: 1. Wine and a DLL with Direct3D API and OpenGL/Vulkan implementation (DXVK, VK9, etc.) 2. Support for Direct3D in Mesa AFAIK Wine with DXVK allows for seamless experience in newest games while Mesa has serious problems even with Direct3D 9. My naive view is that in the end Mesa should be a better solution: less overhead, Wine-independent and Direct3D support in native Linux apps.

Here ( is first info on a new demo of King's Field II for Windows/PlayStation VR. The icon is not working for me. I think this is a new bug in Windows. The EXE has an icon. You can nix the ugly system icon by adding an "ICON=KING'S FIELD II.exe" line to the SOM file. It will not use the same icon, but will use one with a transparent background that the launcher uses. I don't know if I will advertise this further. Maybe. For some reason the game crashes after a few minutes of play. It was working a few days before this, but not working now, I tried clearing everything, turned off cloud save on steam, got rid of saves, uninstalled the game, reinstalled, didn't put the saves back in to test it and still crashed.

Motherboard's Realtek onboard audio I'm using Antergos v18.1 install image and choosing Gnome. I enabled the AUR repo during installation configuration and that's it. From a fresh. Some videos load as purple and green vertical bars for video, while the audio plays like normal. The only way to fix it is to disable hardware acceleration, which makes Waterfox bog down pretty easily. My video card is an EVGA Nvidia GT 730, I'm using the latest drivers.

Have searched a lot with google to find other users conf file. After going through a lot of them i have made the following mpv.conf.

Maybe not as good as it was before, but there's been so many Meltdown/Spectre patches going out (which is why I updated to 390.65, staying on top of this stuff) that it's hard to tell what's causing what.
